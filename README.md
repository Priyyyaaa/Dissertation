# Predictive Analysis of Maternal Depression

There are several mums who undergo a lot of emotional and physical pain during and after pregnancy. The Society has stigmatized the mental health awareness and well-being. Mental Well-being is completely ignored by the expectant and new mums. Due to this, women in the perinatal period do not speak about what they are going through as many people are unaware of the long-lasting impact of poor mental health not only the mother but also her children. 

In this study, the main aim is to predict antenatal depression (depression during pregnancy) and postpartum pregnancy (depression after delivery) based on different sets of questionnaires. The data can be used to identify factors that can cause depression in parents, predict depression based on the past, and how depression affects kids. The objectives of this study are:

i.	Identifying the factors that can lead to depression in pregnant and new moms. Factors include Support from friends, family, and partners at different points of the study, the Relationship quality of a couple, and the quality of parenting. 

ii.	Predicting depression in different stages of motherhood based on the past data

iii.	Analysing whether depression in mothers can affect a childâ€™s behavioural aspects.
